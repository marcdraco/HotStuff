This is beta 1

Aiming to become the greatest little grahping thermometer/hydrometer available for an Arduino Uno

Applications include:

* Infant/nursery temperature monitor
* Outbuilding temperature monitor
* Greenhouse monitor
* HVAC check and monitoring


* Uses a DHT11 (at a pinch, we haven't tried) or DHT22 to get temp and relative humidity.
* Displays relative humidity and temperature in fahrenheit  or celcius
* Can warn of humid or dry atmospheres which are harmful to our health!
* Can check and warn for ice or icy conditions
* Uses Steadman's calculations to for uncomfortable or dangerous working conditions
* Records min and maximum temperature and relative humidity
* Requires a minimum of parts Uno, 3.5" TFT shield, PTMRTB (momentary) button, LED & resistor
* Simple to build
* Clean, fully commented code (yeah, in my dreams)
